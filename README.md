I chose: Javascript Problem Sets

Problem #1

Which 3 jQuery functions do you use the most? Implement them in plain javascript.
The vanilla-to-jquery folder contains 2 examples of vanilla javascript to jquery.  I did
not have time to describe all three requested examples.


Problem #2

Using test driven development, implement a single calculator object that does: multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction, operations.

The calculator folder contains the jquery calculator.  I did not have time to
include the tests for this problem.   


Problem #3

What’s the value 2 way data bindings on HTML forms?

Implement form validation using (1) plain javascript and (2) a popular framework for username and password where the email must be valid and the password must contains 1 capital letter, 1 lowercase letter, and 1 symbol (!@#$%^&) character. We’ll let you define what a valid email address is.
The angular folder contains the code for form validation.  

I was needing more time to render the image on the page.  My next step, if I had more time, would be
to begin to de-bug to see why my form is not rendering on the page.  I would start
with console.log on my component.js page to see if the javascript is being executed.
I would then check to see if I had required all pages and modules and made sure that
the spelling of all components was correct.  I would eliminate all obvious potential
problems and then narrow down until I was able to pinpoint the problem.
