The angular folder contains the code for form validation.  I was needing more
time to render the image on the page.  My next step, if I had more time, would be
to begin to de-bug to see why my form is not rendering on the page.  I would start
with console.log on my component.js page to see if the javascript is being executed.
I would then check to see if I had required all pages and modules and made sure that
the spelling of all components was correct.  I would eliminate all obvious potential
problems and then narrow down until I was able to pinpoint the problem.

The calculator folder contains the jquery calculator.  I did not have time to
include the tests for this problem.   

The vanilla-to-jquery folder contains 2 examples of vanilla javascript to jquery.  I did
not have time to describe all three requested examples.
